* A "Close" button to close the dialog.

## Notes ##

* You can close this dialog just by pressing Escape.
* You can assign a shortcut to open the dialog in "Input gestures" menu and, more precisely, in the "Tools" category.

## To navigate through the topic lists ##

When you press the button corresponding to a topic, this should open up a dialog box consisting of:

* A list of items from which you can navigate with the vertical arrows.
* An "Open" button, which should allow you to access the selected item in the list.
* An "Add" button, which should allow you to add a new item in the list.
* A "Rename the key" button, which should allow you to rename the selected item in the list.
* A "Modify value" button, which should allow you to modify the value of the selected item in the list.
* A "Delete" button, which should allow you to remove the selected item in the list.
* A "Close" button, which should allow you to close the dialog.

## Notes ##

* You can press the escape button to close each dialog box, and return to the dialog with access to the lists buttons.
* You can assign a shortcut to open each dialog in "Input gestures" menu and, more precisely, in the "Tools" category.
* When no item is present in the list, only the "Add" and "Close" buttons are displayed.
